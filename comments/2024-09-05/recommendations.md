# Recommendations Based on a Critique of ExCUE & Subsequent Feedback
These recommendations are based on [feedback] I received following my
[presentation] on 5 Sep 2024, which included specific critiques of the ExCUE
proposal as it existed at that time. As I summarized at the top of the slide
deck:

> Emerging from sessions at the D:food/web Cultivation Station, the [ExC] &
> [Utility-Enterprise Hybrid Entity] funding models (together as ExCUE) were
> drafted in the weeks following DWeb Camp 2024. While they promise much to
> privately funded and institutionally supported contributors to the free & open
> source ag-tech commons, they raise concerns for independent contributors and
> the wider community of unaffiliated supporters. [The Runrig Plan] is presented
> as an alternative model for achieving many, though not all, of the same
> objectives.


I'd be willing to give an updated version of this presentation to a wider
audience or to discuss my concerns in a more casual gathering, if either is
requested, but in lieu of that, I'll just leave these recommendations here in
case they prove useful, along with my original [slides] and the other notes I've
included in [this repository].

## Recommendations
My interest in collaborating with such an entity or becoming one of its
signatories would be greatly encouraged if at least one or all four of these
recommendations were integrated into the proposed charter:

1. Establish the charter on a common mission to support __Food Sovereignty and
   Tech Sovereignty__ movements an international level.
2. Adopt the __GNU Public License Version 3 (GPLv3) or a [GPL compatible]
   licensing requirement__ in place of the CopyFair license suggested in the
   original [Collaboration Monster proposal], whether or not trademark is
   employed as an enforcement mechanism.
3. Commit to __large-scale, common infrastructure as the shared stake__ that
   fundamentally aligns incentives and galvanizes support; eliminate pooled
   intellectual property (IP) from the charter entirely.
4. __Retitle investors as sponsors__, or equivalent, wherever the charter or
   other agreement stipulates eligible sources of funding in the utility or
   common infrastructure.


### Prioritize Food & Tech Sovereignty
> 1. Establish the charter on a common mission to support __Food Sovereignty and
>   Tech Sovereignty__ movements on an international scale.

Focus the mission on building stronger connections and new synergies _between_
the two movements and the existing institutions that, for the most part, operate
independently today. Any initiatives should advance the work of both movements,
jointly or severally, while acknowledging the existing leadership of the groups
that have been working in each of these arenas for decades now, predominantly
from indigenous communities.

More than anything else, I would be greatly encouraged if Food & Tech
Sovereignty (F&TS), as a combined principle, was made central to the charter and
the organization's mission, while also explicitly acknowledged as an [intrinsic
value] of all its signatories. Previous initiatives, such as GOAT or OpenTEAM,
have prioritized free & open source software (FOSS) and regenerative agriculture
(RA) as their main unifying principles, while tech sovereignty and food
sovereignty were largely left inferred. A newly chartered federation, I should
hope, would prioritize F&TS _first_, while giving FOSS and RA status only
insofar as they can be shown to promote F&TS. This reorientation would indicate
the ethical foundation of the charter and the moral standard of its signatories,
rather than just its advised practices. The charter and its signatories may
still espouse FOSS & RA as practices they consider instrumental in realizing
F&TS – perhaps even indispensible factors in achieving it – but they are still
only instrumental to F&TS and do not supersede it as intrinsic values in their
own right.

In doing so, such an alliance could partner with groups whose missions are more
readily aligned with F&TS than with FOSS and RA alone. Arguably, this could
expand the range opportunities well beyond the kind of partnerships previously
available to OpenTEAM and GOAT. The charter group and its signatories offer
support to, and invite participation from, the indigenous groups around the
world who have been the primary movers for the Food & Data Sovereignty
movements. Other opportunities might be found among partners specializing in
data governance models, such as data trusts and cooperatives. Below are a few
such partner organizations that may be possible, if not already established.

### Require GPL Compatibility

The CopyFair license was appropriate for machine learning applications because:
(1) the models and the training data have particular characteristics, and (2)
the efficacy of any one model is tightly coupled to that of the training data.
The model itself rarely merits much value all on its own, though it enjoys
greater enforceability as an indisputably copyrightable, creative work. Its
worth depends disproportionately upon the quality, size, compatibility, and
appropriateness of the training data, for which exclusivity can only be assured
by restricting access, usually in the form of service-level agreements (SLA)
combined with adequate security measures that limit access control. The
viability of copyrighting such data is highly contested, since it must
demonstrate a [threshold of originality] that can be difficult to ascertain for
large datasets of mixed provenance.

Nothing indicates that the same unique circumstances prevail with the
agricultural software and the data we anticipate producing or working with.
Circumstances couldn't differ more with regard to the data itself. Vital to many
of our stakeholders is the the principle of users owning and controlling their
own data. Presumably, end users would _not_ be signatories of this charter
themselves, so it would be difficult to apply any blanket licensing agreements
to that data without careful consultation with them first. They may prefer to
decide on licensing terms independently from this group's decisions or the terms
of the charter. Without putting in place robust procedures for how signatories
could exempt themselves from aspects of the charter (in order to meet the
varying demands of their users), or how they might propose frequent amendments
to the charter, it's hard to see how stipulating licensing terms of any sort
would be practical, beyond mere advisory statements.

On the other hand, by requiring GPL compatibility for all licenses on the
software that actually generates and processes that data, users would be
reasonably assured of their continued access to their data with the freedom to
migrate to another platform at any point, whether or not the new platform was a
signatory. Furthermore, the software license alone would not impede users from
making independent decisions about how or to whom they license their data,
although they could of course enter into independent data use agreements that
prohibit them from agreeing to others. For signatories, meanwhile, GPL
compatibility would greatly simplify the licensing process from the start. It
would also ensure contributors – whether they were signatories or not, or
whether they were affiliated with a signatory institution or not – that they
could enjoy continued access to the source code and could continue contributing
regardless of their status or future revisions of the charter. This too would be
an ultimate benefit to end users, since it would afford them more options in
terms of both available software and available developers to improve existing
software. The virtuous cycles that would emerge are already well attested, as in
the community of Drupal developers and users.

Compatible licenses include the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL),

### Infrastructure as Common Stake
> 3. Commit to __large-scale, common infrastructure as the shared stake__ that
>    fundamentally aligns incentives and galvanizes support; eliminate pooled
>    intellectual property (IP) from the charter entirely.

Such infrastructure could run the gamut of generic hosting or storage services,
standards, or even physical networking or computing infrastructure; it might be
achieved through small, iterative steps or large-scale, monolithic achievements;
however, in all cases, it should far exceed the scope and capabilities of the
independent contributors and smaller institutions that would sign onto the
charter. I should hope that any such chartered federation or consortium, working
in a top-down fashion and with a considerable pool of resources to draw upon,
would set an ambitious mandate for itself and not settle for what can be
achieved by smaller institutions. To put it bluntly: swing for the fences!

Meanwhile, leave end-user applications, plugins, minor integrations, and basic
services to be built by the constituent signatories. Smaller, unaffiliated or
independent contributors, such as Runrig or the farmOS community, can be
especially flexible and agile when it comes to satisfying niche use cases and
minor development. Their flexibility should be an advantage to the larger
signatories and the charter federation as a whole, because they can take the
more tedious, piecemeal commitments off their plate. These are the [`wontfix`]
issues I referred to in my presentation. To my view, the best argument for
federating into a larger institution, equipped with the resources to tackle more
ambitious infrastructural projects and ecosystem-level design, is that it can
leverage the unique advantages of working both top-down and bottom-up at the
same time. It should reap the benefits of both its smallest contributors and its
largest, but to do so it must marshall their unique strengths and acuities to
where they can each be most effective.

That said, there is a lot of low hanging fruit, even as infrastructure, that
could be achieved relatively quickly and would be of immediate value, if
undertaken by the larger group. For example, it could stand up a shared instance
of the [Community Solid Server] or the [Atomic Data Server] for hosting Personal
Online Data Stores ([PODS]), or an [OpenID] provider, such as the [Keycloak]
server operated by [Les Communs] and used by the [DFC] for single sign-on (SSO)
(I'm speaking here in terms of my own immediate self-interest, that any one of
examples would be of real tangible value, like, yesterday; draw whatever
conclusions from that as you will). Developing standards and protocols could be
another big component, but can be broken down into components smaller yet, like
how DFC started with specifying product catalogs, then expanded from there.

The fact that there are a number of groups already working on standards and
infrastructure, albeit very slowly, should only be a further inducement. Just as
the DFC has been working on standards, there are others working on
infrastructure, but none of them are resourced well enough to keep up with the
needs of the community – not the way the way the charter organization proposes
to be. Among these are the [servers.coop] collective of tech co-ops, which in
turn includes [Autonomic] and [Cyberia Computer Club], as well as [May First
Co-Op] and [Les Communs], both mentioned above. Any one of them would be
invaluable partners going forward, and together could greatly accelerate the
work of such an entity and another powerful justification for funding.

### Sponsors, not Investors
> 4. __Retitle investors as sponsors__, or equivalent, wherever the charter or
>    other agreement stipulates eligible sources of funding in the utility or
>    common infrastructure.

The term _sponsor_ is often used by farmOS and other FOSS projects to designate
an organization or individual who commissions new work to be entered into the
public commons thereafter. If the funds are not earmarked for a specific project
or initiative, plenty of other terms could be applied, such as _donors_,
_funders_, _endowers_, etc.

I'm assuming here, as David Thomas indicated in the feedback session, that
wherever a mention of "investors" or "returns" occurs in these proposals, it's
meant in the sense of shared posterity or the commonweal, as in "investing in
our children's future" or similar. It strikes me as a peculiar usage, and if it
is retained, it should be explained more clearly, preferably with some
background or precedence for such usage. If equity _is_ implied, I should hope
it refers to a private arrangement between an enterprise and its direct
investors, not the investors in the utility itself, and I don't see the need to
incorporate that language into the charter or other agreements that may effect
the signatories as a group.

All semantics aside, prohibiting equity investments and returns on the common
utility is a pretty hard requirement, personally. To my mind it's antithetical
to the whole notion of a common utility or public good. Once I'm paid for my
labor, I have no intention of claiming royalties or dividends based on my
contributions to the commons; I absolutely will not tolerate others rent-seeking
on software my labor produced. I choose to contribute to the free software
commons specifically because it guarantees everyone the right to use those tools
freely. It also guarantees my own right to continue developing them as I see
fit, which is essential to my livelihood. I will not sign any agreement that
diminishes or endangers _any_ of those rights.

The only exception to this prohibition on equity investments, which I would
tolerate but would not advise, would be an investment in physical infrastructure
or services, on the stipulation of capping all returns. Something like a limited
credit or rebate on its use seems preferable if that was the case.


## Presentation Feedback
Some important clarifications, observations, and suggestions from the feedback
session that followed my presentation. I owe a great thanks to the people below
and all who participated for sharing their insights.

- David Thomas
  - The type of "investments" being considered are more like financial
    endowments than they are equity investments, with the two prominent
    investors so far being purely foundations or, in the case of NRI, a
    foundation partnered with a legally separate equity fund, in what's
    sometimes called an [integrated capital] approach.
  - There is still strong support for copyleft licensing like the GPL coming
    from within the ExCUE group; in particular, Greg Austic has been very
    insistent on this point.
- Dani Dhanoa
  - Madelynn, especially, should hear these critiques and respond.
- Will Gardiner
  - Collaboration Monster is not all about CopyFair and trademark as an enforcement mechanism; it's about working to align incentives and galvanize support through shared commitments.
  - What ExCUE and Runrig are both trying to do inevitably leads to scope creep,
    so how can they each tighten their scope to complement each other and focus
    on what each does best.
  - The Collaboration Monster was informed by the way the Wikimedia Foundation's
    relationship to Wikipedians and other volunteer contributors. The former and
    its paid staff do not write any content, they just provide the
    infrastructure while volunteers produce all the content themselves
- Paul Weidner
  - The metaphor of "local maxima in the fitness landscape" is helpful and could be a made into a useful mapping exercise to identify problems ExCUE and/or Runrig could address; e.g., self-hosting is a good example of a local maximum farmOS has gotten stuck on.
- Vic S-F
  - From chat: "agreed on next step of fronting the real work & tangible plans we are currently doing as resources that exist and we should think about when we're moving into balloon chainsaw world"
